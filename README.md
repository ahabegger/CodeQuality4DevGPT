# CodeQuality4DevGPT: ChatGPT Quality Issues and Linters

This project focuses on the quality issues that are commonly found in the code generated by ChatGPT. We use various linters to analyze the quality of the generated code. The project supports multiple programming languages including Python, Java, and JavaScript.

## Quality Issues in ChatGPT

ChatGPT, while a powerful tool, can sometimes generate code with quality issues. These issues can range from minor stylistic problems to more serious issues like logical errors or inefficient code. Our project aims to identify these issues. We use linters to analyze the code generated by ChatGPT and identify quality issues in the code. The generated code is comes from the [DevGPT](https://github.com/NAIST-SE/DevGPT) database. 

## Linters

Linters are tools that analyze source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs. In this project, we use a variety of linters for different programming languages to help identify  quality issues in the code.

### Python Linters

- **[Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/)**: Integrates tools like PyFlakes, pycodestyle, and Ned Batchelder's McCabe script. It checks for coding style, programming errors, and complex or buggy code.
- **[Pylint](https://pypi.org/project/pylint/)**: Offers more comprehensive code analysis than Flake8, checking whether the module meets coding standards and suggesting improvements. It is highly customizable.

### Java Linters

- **[Checkstyle](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/)**: Focuses on coding standards and conventions. It is highly configurable and can be adapted to most coding standards.
- **[PMD](https://pmd.github.io/)**: Looks for potential bugs, dead code, suboptimal code, and overcomplicated expressions. PMD includes CPD, a Copy/Paste Detector to find duplicate code.
- **[SpotBugs](https://spotbugs.github.io/) (formerly FindBugs)**: Analyzes bytecode to identify potential errors in Java code, offering detailed feedback on bug patterns.

### JavaScript Linters

- **[ESLint](https://eslint.org/)**: Highly customizable, allowing developers to configure rules for coding styles and errors. It supports modern JavaScript features and JSX, making it suitable for React development as well.
- **[JSHint](https://www.jslint.com/)**: Offers flexibility in configuration to catch errors and enforce coding conventions in JavaScript codebases.

## Comparison and Patterns

We also compare the performance of these linters and identify common patterns in the issues they find. This helps us understand the strengths and weaknesses of each linter and how they can complement each other.
