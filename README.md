# CodeQuality4DevGPT

CodeQuality4DevGPT is a project focused on identifying quality issues in code generated by ChatGPT. By utilizing various linters, this project aims to analyze the code for errors ranging from minor stylistic issues to more critical logical and efficiency problems. The analyzed code is sourced from the [DevGPT database](https://github.com/NAIST-SE/DevGPT).
