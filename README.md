# CodeQuality4DevGPT: ChatGPT Quality Issues and Linters

This project focuses on the quality issues that are commonly found in the code generated by ChatGPT. We use various linters to analyze the quality of the generated code. The project supports multiple programming languages.

## Quality Issues in ChatGPT

ChatGPT, while a powerful tool, can sometimes generate code with quality issues. These issues can range from minor stylistic problems to more serious issues like logical errors or inefficient code. Our project aims to identify these issues and provide solutions to improve the quality of the generated code.

## Linters

Linters are tools that analyze source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs. In this project, we use a variety of linters to help identify and rectify quality issues in the code generated by ChatGPT.

### Language Agnostic Linter

We use [coala](https://github.com/coala/coala), a language agnostic linter, which allows us to analyze code written in any programming language.

### Megalinter

[Megalinter](https://megalinter.io/latest/) is another linter we use. It is an easy-to-use and comprehensive linter that supports multiple languages and can be integrated into your CI/CD pipeline.
